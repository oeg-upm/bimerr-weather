Direct Normal Illuminance,-,"This is the Direct Normal Illuminance in lux. (Average amount of illuminance in hundreds of lux
received directly from the solar disk on a surface perpendicular to the sun’s rays, during the number
of minutes preceding the time indicated.)"
 Diffuse Horizontal Illuminance,-,"This is the Diffuse Horizontal Illuminance in lux. (Average amount of illuminance in hundreds of
lux received from the sky (excluding the solar disk) on a horizontal surface during the number of
minutes preceding the time indicated.) "
Zenith Luminance,-,"This is the Zenith Illuminance in Cd/m2. (Average amount of luminance at the sky’s zenith in tens
of Cd/m2 during the number of minutes preceding the time indicated.)"
 Wind Direction,-,"This is the Wind Direction in degrees where the convention is that North = 0.0, East = 90.0, South
= 180.0, West = 270.0. (Wind direction in degrees at the time indicated. If calm, direction equals
zero.) "
Wind Speed,-,This is the wind speed in m/sec. (Wind speed at time indicated.)
Total Sky Cover,-,"This is the value for total sky cover (tenths of coverage). (i.e. 1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total coverage).
(Amount of sky dome in tenths covered by clouds or obscuring phenomena at the hour indicated
at the time indicated.)"
Opaque Sky Cover,-,"This is the value for opaque sky cover (tenths of coverage). (i.e. 1 is 1/10 covered. 10 is total
coverage). (Amount of sky dome in tenths covered by clouds or obscuring phenomena that prevent
observing the sky or higher cloud layers at the time indicated.) "

Ceiling Height,-,"This is the value for ceiling height in m. (77777 is unlimited ceiling height. 88888 is cirroform
ceiling.)"
 Present Weather Observation,-,"Since the primary use of these
fields (Present Weather Observation and Present Weather Codes) is for rain/wet surfaces, a missing
observation field or a missing weather code implies no rain."
Present Weather Codes,-,The present weather codes field is assumed to follow the TMY2 conventions for this field
Precipitable Water,-,"This is the value for Precipitable Water in mm. (This is not rain - rain is inferred from the
PresWeathObs field but a better result is from the Liquid Precipitation Depth field))"
Aerosol Optical Depth,-,This is the value for Aerosol Optical Depth in thousandths
 Snow Depth,-,"This is the value for Snow Depth in cm. This field is used to tell when snow is on the ground and,
thus, the ground reflectance may change"
Days Since Last Snowfall,-,This is the value for Days Since Last Snowfall
Albedo,-,The ratio (unitless) of reflected solar irradiance to global horizontal irradiance
 Liquid Precipitation Depth,-,"The amount of liquid precipitation (mm) observed at the indicated time for the period indicated
in the liquid precipitation quantity field."
 Liquid Precipitation Quantity,-,The period of accumulation (hr) for the liquid precipitation depth field.
Latitude,-,Latitude where the measure was taken in degree minutes represented in decimal (i.e. 30 minutes is .5)
Longitude,-,Longitude where the measure was taken in degree minutes represented in decimal (i.e. 30 minutes is .5)
Altitude,-,Elevation where the measure was taken.
